This package is deprecated.

Before it was deprecated, it was the way to provide analysis options corresponding to the guidelines in _[Effective Dart][]_.

Instead, please see official packages: `package:lints` which is the lint recommendation from the Dart team, or `package:flutter_lints` which extends that for Flutter.
